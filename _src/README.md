# Mastering Scala Machine Learning
Supporting material (code, libs etc) for [Mastering Scala Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-scala-machine-learning?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785880889
) (Packtpub Publishing).


This book is based on open source software. First, it's Java. One can download Java 
from Oracle's Java Download page. You have to accept the license and choose an 
appropriate image for your platform. Don't use OpenJDKâ€”it has a few problems 
with Hadoop/Spark.
Second, Scala. If you are using Mac, I recommend installing Homebrew:
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/
install/master/install)"
Multiple open source packages will also be available to you. To install Scala, run 
brew install scala . Installation on a Linux platform requires downloading an 
appropriate Debian or RPM package from the  http://www.scala-lang.org/
download/ site. We will use the latest version at the time, that is, 2.11.7.
Spark distributions can be downloaded from http://spark.apache.org/
downloads.html. We use pre-build for Hadoop 2.6 and later image. As it's Java, you 
need to just unzip the package and start using the scripts from the bin  subdirectory.
R and Python packages are available at http://cran.r-project.org/bin and 
http://python.org/ftp/python/$PYTHON_VERSION/Python-$PYTHON_VERSION.
tar.xz sites respectively. The text has specific instruction on ho w to configure them. 
Although our use of the packages should be version agnostic, I used R version 3.2.3 
and Python version 2.7.11 in this book
